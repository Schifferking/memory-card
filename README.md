# Memory card

This project uses concepts learned in the previous project and the previous lesson (useEffect hook).
<br>
It's a game where the user will click a card from a group "each round". The user has a score for each game. This score can be increased with one condition: each card must be clicked only once. Lastly, each round the cards are reshuffled.

- Improve style, UI and UX
